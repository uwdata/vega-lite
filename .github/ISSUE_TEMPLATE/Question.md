The issue tracker is for bug reports and feature requests, NOT usage questions.

PLEASE DO NOT CREATE A NEW ISSUE TO ASK A QUESTION.

Instead, ask your usage questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/vega-lite), [the mailing list](https://bit.ly/vega-discuss), or on [Slack](https://bit.ly/join-vega-slack)

The only exception is if you have a question about _the Vega-Lite compiler code itself_.
