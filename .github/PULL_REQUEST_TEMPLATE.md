Please:
- [ ] Make your pull request atomic, fixing one issue at a time unless there are many relevant issues that cannot be decoupled.
- [ ] Provide a test case & update the documentation under `site/docs/`
- [ ] Make lint and test pass. (Run `yarn lint` and `yarn test`.  If your change affects Vega outputs of some examples, please run `yarn build:example EXAMPLE_NAME` to re-compile a specific example or `yarn build:examples` to re-compile all examples.)
- [ ] Make sure you have rebased onto the `master` branch.
- [ ] Provide a concise title so that we can just copy it to our release note.
  - Use imperative mood and present tense.
  - Mention relevant issues. (e.g., `#1`)
