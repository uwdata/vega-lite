Currently Vega-Lite supports the following `mark` types:
`point`, `bar`, `tick`, `line`, `area`, and `text` (text table).

__Coming Soon!: Details for each encoding channel__


<!--
## Point

Point mark can be used with any data type.  It also supports all encoding channels.  

You can create  a dot plots by using `point` with one axis.

```
```

If two axes are encoded, you get scatter plots, which you may additionally encode `color` or `shape`.  

```
```

If you add `size` encoding to a scatter plot, you get a bubble plot instead.  

```
```

You can customize whether to use an open shape or a filled shape using ...

<!--
## Bar

Bar is typically used with one dimension and one quantitative dimension.  

- How orientation is determined
- Bar can be used to create bar chart, stacked bar chart, layered bar chart and grouped bar chart (when combined with facets)
- (Future -- once we have tooltip) -- playing bar's trick with `detail` channel
-->

<!--
## Tick
- Supported data type
- How orientation is determined

-->


<!--
## Line
- Line = ordinal / temporal and typically another measure  
- How sort order is determined
- Custom order for line
- (Future) color
-->


<!--
## Area
- Area = ordinal / temporal and typically another measure  
- How sort order is determined
- Stacking
