The `sort` property of [a mark properties channel](encoding.html#mark-props) determines the order of the scale domain. Supported `sort` values depend on the field's scale type.

## Sorting Continuous Fields

If the channel has a continuous field (quantitative or time), `sort` can have the following values:
- `"ascending"` (Default) –  the field is sorted by the field's value in ascending order.
- `"descending"` –  the field is sorted by the field's value in descending order.

#### Example: Reversed X-Scale

Setting x's `sort` to `"descending"` reverses the x-axis. Thus, the following visualization's x-axis starts on the maximum value of the field "Horsepower" and ends on zero.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="tick_sort"></div>


## Sorting Discrete Fields

If the channel has a discrete scale (ordinal or nominal), `sort` can be one of: `"ascending"`, `"descending"`, [a sort field definition](#sort-field) for sorting by another field, [an array specifying preferred order](#sort), or `null`.

### Sort by the Field's Natural Order

1) Sorting by the values' natural order in Javascript. For example, `"a"` < `"b"`. In this case, `sort` can be:

- `"ascending"` (Default) –  sort by the field's value in ascending order.
- `"descending"` –  sort by the field's value in descending order.

### Sort by a Different Field
{:#sort-field}

2) Sorting by aggregated value of another "sort" field. In this case, `sort` is an __encoding sort field definition__, which has the following properties:

{% include table.html props="field,op,order" source="EncodingSortField" %}

For example, the following plot sorts x by mean of Horsepower.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="histogram_sort_mean"></div>


### Specifying Custom Sort Order
{:#sort-array}

If the `sort` property is an array, it specifies the preferred order of values.

In the case that sort array contains every field value, the sort order will follow the specified values in the array.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="bar_custom_sort_full"></div>

If some values are ignored, the sort order will precede by the specified values in the array while unspecified values will follow their original order.  For example, this plots orders `B`, `A` and `C` first, followed by `Z`, `Y`, `X`.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="bar_custom_sort_partial"></div>

For discrete time fields, values in the sort array can be [date-time definition objects](types#datetime).
In addition, for time units `"month"` and `"day"`, the values can be the month or day names (case insensitive) or their 3-letter initials (e.g., `"Mon"`, `"Tue"`).

For example, the following chart orders the day to start on Monday (instead of Sunday by default).

<div class="vl-example" data-name="circle_github_punchcard"></div>


__Note__: It is also possible to sort by providing custom `scale`'s [`domain`](scale.html#domain). However, it is more error-prone compared to using a `sort` array since `domain` requires every possible value to be included in the array. Thus, any value omitted from `domain` will not render properly.


### No Sorting

If `sort` is `null`, the field is not sorted. This is equivalent to specifying `sort: false` in [Vega's scales](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/scales/#sort).

__Note:__ `null` is not supported for `row` and `column`.
