The filter transform removes objects from a data stream based on a provided filter expression or filter object.

{: .suppress-error}
```json
{
  ...
  "transform": [
    {"filter": ...} // Filter Transform
     ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

Vega-Lite filter transforms must have the `filter` property describing the predicate for the filtering condition.

{% include table.html props="filter" source="FilterTransform" %}


{:#expression}
## Filter Expression

For an [expression](types.html#expression) string, each datum object can be referred using bound variable `datum`. For example, setting `filter` to `"datum.b2 > 60"` would make the output data includes only items that have values in the field `b2` over 60.


## Field Predicate

For a filter predicate, a `field` must be provided along with one of the predicate properties: ([`equal`](#equal-predicate), [`range`](#range-predicate), or [`oneOf`](#oneofilter)). Values of these operators can be primitive types (string, number, boolean) or a [DateTime definition object](types.html#datetime) to describe time. In addition, `timeUnit` can be provided to further transform a temporal `field`.

{:#equal-predicate}
### Field Equal Predicate

{% include table.html props="field,equal,timeUnit" source="FieldEqualPredicate" %}

For example, to check if the `car_color` field's value is equal to `"red"`, we can use the following filter:

{: .suppress-error}
```json
{"filter": {"field": "car_color", "equal": "red"}}
```

{:#range-predicate}
### Field Range Predicate

{% include table.html props="field,range,timeUnit" source="FieldRangePredicate" %}

**Examples**

- `{"filter": {"field": "x", "range": [0, 5]}}` checks if the `x` field's value is in range [0,5] (0 ≤ x ≤ 5).
- `{"filter": {"field": "x", "range": [null, 5]}}` checks if the `x` field's value is in range [-Infinity,5] (x ≤ 5).
- `{"filter": {"timeUnit": "year", "field": "date", "range": [2006, 2008] }}` checks if the `date`'s value is between year 2006 and 2008.
- `{"filter": {"field": "date", "range": [{"year": 2006, "month": "jan", "date": 1}, {"year": 2008, "month": "feb", "date": 20}] }}` checks if the `date`'s value is between Jan 1, 2006  and Feb 20, 2008.


{:#one-of-predicate}
### Field One-Of Predicate

{% include table.html props="field,oneOf,timeUnit" source="FieldOneOfPredicate" %}

For example, `{"filter": {"field": "car_color", "oneOf":["red", "yellow"]}}` checks if the `car_color` field's value is `"red"` or `"yellow"`.

{:#selection-predicate}
## Selection Predicate

For a selection predicate, a `selection` name  must be provided.

{% include table.html props="selection" source="SelectionPredicate" %}

For example, with `{"filter": {"selection": "brush"}}`, only data values that fall within the selection named `brush` will remain in the dataset as shown below.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="selection_filter"></div>

All [selection composition](selection.html#compose) can be used here as well. For instance, `{"filter": {"selection": {"and": ["alex", "morgan"]}}}` filters for data values that are within both the `alex` and `morgan` selections.
