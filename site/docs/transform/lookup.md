The lookup transform extends a primary data source by looking up values from another data source. It is similar to a one sided join.

```js
// Any View Specification
{
  ...
  "transform": [
    {"lookup": ..., "from" ..., "as": ..., "default": ...} // Lookup Transform
     ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Lookup Transform

For each data object in the main data source, the transform tries to find a matching objects in the secondary data source. An object matches if the value in the field specified by `lookup` is the same as the field specified in the `from.key`.

{% include table.html props="lookup,from,as,default" source="LookupTransform" %}

### Lookup Data

The secondary data reference (set with `from`) can be object that specifies how the lookup key should be matched to a second data source and what fields should be added.

{% include table.html props="data,key,fields" source="LookupData" %}

#### Example

This example uses `lookup` to add the properties `age` and `height` to the main data source. The `person` field in the main data source is matched to the `name` field in the secondary data source.

<span class="vl-example" data-name="lookup"></span>

### Lookup Selection

The secondary data reference (set with `from`) canalso be a selection name reference.

{% include table.html props="selection" source="LookupSelection" %}

#### Example: Interactive Index Chart

<span class="vl-example" data-name="interactive_index_chart"></span>
