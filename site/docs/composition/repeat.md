The `repeat` operator is part of Vega-Lite's [view composition](composition.html). It provides a shortcut that creates a view for each entry in an array of fields. This operator generates multiple plots like [`facet`](facet.html). However, unlike `facet` it allows full replication of a data set in each view.

## Repeat Operator

To repeat a view, define what fields should be used for each entry. Then define the repeated view in `spec` with a reference to a repeated field (`{"repeat": ...}`).

```js
{
  "repeat": {
    ... // Repeat definition
  },
  "spec": ... // Specification
}
```

In addition to [common properties of a view specification](spec.html#common), a repeat specification has the following properties:

{% include table.html props="repeat,spec,columns" source="RepeatSpec" %}

{: #repeat-mapping}

## Row/Column Repeat Mapping

The `repeat` property can be an object with two optional properties (`"row"` and `"column"`), which define the list of fields that should be repeated into a row or column.

{% include table.html props="row,column" source="RepeatMapping" %}

## Examples

### Repeated Line Charts

For instance, you can use this operator to quickly create an overview over the trends in multiple variables.

<span class="vl-example" data-name="repeat_line_weather"></span>

Note how the field for the y channel refers to a repeated field.

```js
"y": {
  "field": {"repeat": "repeat"}
  ...
},
```

### Repeated Histogram (Wrapped)

<span class="vl-example" data-name="repeat_histogram"></span>

### Scatterplot Matrix (SPLOM)

Repeat can be used to create a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM), where each cell shows a different 2D projection of the same data table. Here, we define **both** `row` and `column`.

<span class="vl-example" data-name="repeat_splom_iris"></span>

You can also check the [interactive SPLOM example](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/interactive_splom.html).

## Resolve

The default [resolutions](resolve.html) for repeat are independent scales and axes for [position channels](encoding.html#position) and shared scales and legends for all other channels. Currently, Vega-Lite does not support shared axes for repeated views.

## Repeat Configuration

```js
// Top-level View Specification
{
  ...,
  "config": { // Configuration Object

    "repeat": { // - Repeat Configuration
      "spacing": ...,
      "columns": ...,
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

The repeat configuration supports the following properties:

{% include table.html props="columns,spacing" source="CompositionConfig" %}
