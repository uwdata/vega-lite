Sometimes, it's useful to superimpose one chart on top of another. You can accomplish this by using the `layer` property.
To define a layered chart, you only have to assign an array of chart objects to `layer`.

#### Example
Let's create a chart that shows the mean price of individual stocks.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="layer_single_mean"></div>
Of course `layer` isn't needed here, it's added only for demonstrational purposes.
Now, let's draw a simple line chart of prices of stocks.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="layer_single_color"></div>

Now, let's add the chart into the layer array.
<div class="vl-example" data-name="layer_line_color_rule"></div>

And voila! You have a layered chart.
##### Note
When you have different scales in different layers, the scale domains are unioned so that all layers can use the same scale. However, you might choose to avoid that by using `resolve`.

##### Advanced Example
The population of the German city of Falkensee over time. Based on a [visualization built using Vega]((https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/falkensee-population/)).
<div class="vl-example" data-name="layered_falkensee">
