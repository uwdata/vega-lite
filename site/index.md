**Vega-Lite** is a high-level visualization grammar. It provides a concise JSON syntax for supporting rapid generation of visualizations to support analysis. Vega-Lite specifications can be compiled to [Vega](http://vega.github.io/vega) specifications.


<span class="lead-columns">
  <span>
    Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as mappings from data to **properties of graphical marks** (e.g., points or bars). It **automatically produces visualization components** including axes, legends, and scales. It then determines properties of these components based on a set of **carefully designed rules**. This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be succinct and expressive, but also provide user control. As Vega-Lite is designed for analysis, it supports **data transformations** such as aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting, and **visual transformations** including stacking and faceting.

## Example

This is a Vega-Lite specification to create a bar chart that shows the average temperature in Seattle for each month.

<div class="vl-example" data-name="bar_month"></div>
