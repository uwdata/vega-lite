 * Abstract interface for implementing a data component compiler
 * that produces a part of a data source.
 *
 * Each type of data component compiler should have a common data component (T),
 * which stores minimal set of properties that can be merged
 * and assembled into the desired output.
 *
 * For some data component type, the component might simply be the desired output
 * if the desired output is already easy to merge.  However, that is not the
 * case for all types of data components.
